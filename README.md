This repository explores the dynamics behind student friendshipgroups at Habib University in Karachi, through the lens of Homophily. To do this we performed a survey in an attempt to answe the the following questions.

1. % of friends within major
2. Friends with Classmates Outside of Class
3. CS Students who are Friends with Classmates Outside of Class
4. SDP Students who are Friends with Classmates Outside of Class
5. SSE Students having friends of other genders

Our results found that students are more likely to have friends from within their major. In additon, SSE females were found to be more likely to have male friends. This may be a result of the lack of female representation in the sciences.
